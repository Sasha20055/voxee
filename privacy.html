            similar vendors bound by confidentiality agreements.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Legal &amp; safety</strong> – when required by law or to protect rights,
            property, or safety of users, the public, or Company.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Business transfers</strong> – in connection with a merger, acquisition, or asset
            sale (you will be notified beforehand).

    <h2 style={{marginTop: "1.5em"}}>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        We keep your information only as long as necessary for the purposes described above, unless

        securely delete or anonymize it.

    <p>
        We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards—such as encryption at rest and in
        transit, access controls, and regular security audits—to protect your information. No system
        is 100% secure, but we continuously work to improve our defences.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2 style={{marginTop: "1.5em"}}>7. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
        Your information may be processed and stored outside your country of residence. Where
        required, we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses or other approved safeguards to protect
        transferred data.

        provided us personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.
